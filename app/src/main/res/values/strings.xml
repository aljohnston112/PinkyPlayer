        The min number of songs determines the amount of songs you will hear
        when the algorithm finds the songs you like.
        The lower this number, the less songs you will hear
        when the algorithm finds the songs you like.
        At 1, your favorite song will play a lot after a while until
        you use the menu in the app bar to reset or lower the probabilities.

        The mods (1-100) determine how much weight the algorithm uses
        when the thumb up, thumb down, or skip button are tapped or held down.
        1 makes the smallest change and 100 makes the largest change.
        When Min number of songs is 1 and mod up is 100, a song will take the least number of taps to play a lot.
        When mod down is 1, songs will take a lot of taps until you do not hear them as often.
